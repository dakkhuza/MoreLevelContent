Ever get bored of levels? Ruins, shipwrecks and beacons a plenty not filling that void in your dented diving suit?

Ever wanted MORE things to do in levels? And not just a different looking wreck or a beacon station with hostile humans but actual NEW content? 

Well then it's a good thing you're already on this page!

Pirate missions are a real highlight of barotrauma (for me). HOWEVER I feel they are brought down a bit by the fact the pirates never really get the chance to sneak up on you! You almost always have the drop on them and that doesn't feel right.

With Pirate Outposts getting the drop on those pesky pirates is a thing of the past! Randomly spawning only sometimes in levels (chance based on level difficulty), Pirate Outposts will not hesitate to pepper your hull with all sorts of fun armaments.

The pirates themselves aren't pushovers either. Each area has it's own set of blood thirsty marauders ready to turn you into the immediate past president of the "being alive" club, Ha. Ha. This is also affected by difficulty.
