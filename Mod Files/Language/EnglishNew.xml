    <!-- Loading Tips -->
    <loadingscreentip>Distress beacons won't last forever, they will disapear from the map after some time.</loadingscreentip>
    <loadingscreentip>Jump starters can be used to restart shuttles that have run out of power.</loadingscreentip>
    <loadingscreentip>If you take your time getting to a distress beacon, whoever activated it might be dead by the time you show up.</loadingscreentip>
    <loadingscreentip>If you have Dynamic Europa installed, high reputation with the Bandit faction will turn pirate bases passive.</loadingscreentip>
    <loadingscreentip>There have been reports of pirate bases using unknown technology to jam sonnar.</loadingscreentip>
    <loadingscreentip>Following stange sonar pings may lead to automatic traders, waystations or other structures. Who knows what you could find!</loadingscreentip>
